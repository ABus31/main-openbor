 Function description:

- block {int}
 Sets blocking status
 0 = block status is off
 1 = block status is on

- move {x} {z} {y}
 Teleports with certain distance
 x = x movement
 z = z movement
 y = y movement


- dasher {x} {y} {z}
 Dash with desired speed. Similar to 'jumpframe' with no frame requirement
 x = x speed
 y = y speed
 z = z speed

- leaper {x} {y} {z}
 Jump with desired speed. Same as 'jumpframe' with no frame requirement
 x = x speed
 y = y speed
 z = z speed

- clearL
 Clears all local variables

- keyint {animation} {frame} {key} {hold} {minhealth}
 Change current animation if defined key is pressed or released provided HP is more than minimum health
 animation = animation to change to
 frame = frame to start
 key = key to press or release. Accepted values are:
  "U" = Up
  "D" = Down
  "J" = Jump
  "A" = Attack
  "S" = Special
  "A2" = Attack2
 hold = hold/release flag.
  0 = Hold
  1 = Release
 minhealth = Minimum health char must have

- keyflip
 Change facing direction if left or right is pressed

- shoot {projectilename} {x} {y} {z}
 Shoot projectile from certain distance. Same as 'throwframe' without frame requirement
 projectilename = name of shot projectile
 x = x distance relative to char
 y = y distance relative to char
 z = z distance relative to char

- toss {bombname} {x} {y} {z}
 Toss bomb from certain distance. Same as 'tossframe' without frame requirement
 projectilename = name of shot projectile
 x = x distance relative to char
 y = y distance relative to char
 z = z distance relative to char
